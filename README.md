# Programming Skills Portfolio  
### Student: **Tarek Sankari**  
### Module: CodeLab I

This repository is where I’ve collected all my C++ tasks for the module.  
The exercises focus on basic programming skills like variables, loops, conditions, functions, and simple array work.  
Each task is in its own folder and shows my progress as I learned the fundamentals.
